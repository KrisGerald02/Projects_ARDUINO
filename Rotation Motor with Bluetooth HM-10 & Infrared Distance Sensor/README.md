# 🎛️ Rotation Motor with Bluetooth & Infrared Distance Sensor

## 📌 Project Overview  
This circuit uses a Bluetooth module (HM-10) and a microcontroller (Arduino R4 MINIMA) to wirelessly control two DC motors with encoder disks. The motors are driven by an H-bridge (L9110s), while encoder signals are read to monitor speed and direction. Additionally, an infrared distance sensor (GP2Y0A21YK0F) is included for object detection or distance measurement. This setup is ideal for robotics or mobile vehicles that require real-time feedback and remote control.

## 🛠️ Components Required  
- Arduino R4 MINIMA  
- Jumper wires  
- L9110 H-bridge driver  
- TT Motor with Encoder Disk  
- Bluetooth 4.0 Module HM-10 (compatible with iOS & Android)  
- Infrared Distance Sensor GP2Y0A21YK0F
